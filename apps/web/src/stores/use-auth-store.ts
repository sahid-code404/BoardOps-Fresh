/**
 * SEC-3 — Auth state is now primarily stored in an httpOnly cookie set by the
 * login/verify-otp routes. The token kept here in localStorage is intentionally
 * retained for two reasons:
 *   1. As a client-side hint that the user is signed in before the first API
 *      call resolves (e.g. for the initial route guard in `AppShell`).
 *   2. As a backward-compat `Authorization: Bearer` fallback that the API
 *      accepts alongside the cookie. The server prefers the cookie when both
 *      are present (see `getSessionToken` in `src/lib/session.ts`).
 *
 * On logout, the client clears this store AND calls `/api/auth/logout`, which
 * clears the httpOnly cookie server-side.
